Summary of Summer Development Program Sprint-1

The Summer Development Program Sprint-1, conducted from 15th May 2024 to 24th May 2024, offered an extensive learning experience on embedded systems, product development, Agile methodology, Git and GitHub, and PCB design. The program began with Dr. Rajesh Sola providing an engaging and informative session on the industry perspective of embedded systems. Participants learned about the various segments of embedded systems, revolutionary technologies transforming the field, and key companies leading the industry. A practical task was assigned, where each group researched embedded systems in a specific sector; our group explored the medical industry, focusing on companies like Abbott, Medtronic, and Medi Buddy.

Dr. Prithvi Sekhar Pagala led the subsequent session on the Product Development Life Cycle (PDLC). Key aspects of PDLC covered included idea generation using the 4W & 1H method, performing SWOT analysis, deriving high-level and low-level requirements, design and development of prototypes using UML tools, rigorous testing for performance and safety, and implementation involving coding, quality checks, and peer reviews.

The second day featured a workshop on Agile methodology with instructors Priyadarshini Kabaka and Anurag Kumar. The session emphasized the efficiency of Agile compared to traditional methodologies through interactive activities like Planning Poker and a true/false quiz. Key topics included the fundamentals of Agile, scrum ceremonies, daily scrums, and the usage of Kanban charts in projects. This was followed by a session on CV making and LinkedIn profile optimization by Bharadwaj Y.S.N., covering the importance of resumes, LinkedIn profile optimization, AI tools for job searches, cold emails, and effective networking.

On the third day, Bharath G. introduced Git and GitHub, explaining their use in industry projects. Participants learned about source control management (SCM), version control systems (VCS), differences between Git and GitHub, creating repositories, and essential Git commands. Practical activities included designing and implementing a calculator project, performing PDLC analysis, creating flowcharts and block diagrams, and pushing code to GitHub.

The fourth day focused on a PCB workshop led by Dr. Arvind Kumar and Girish Shankar Mishra. The session covered the advantages and disadvantages of breadboards and PCBs, the PCB manufacturing process, and tools for PCB design. Participants created circuits in TinkerCad and EasyEDA, generated Gerber files, and implemented an LED blinking circuit using a 555 timer. The fifth day continued the PCB workshop with hands-on implementation of analog and digital circuits on a breadboard, comparing software and hardware outputs.

The program concluded with sessions on Arduino circuit implementation in Wokwi, conducted by Dr. Rajesh Sola, covering digital outputs, digital inputs, analog inputs, analog outputs, and serial communication. Participants utilized platforms like Wokwi and TinkerCAD for simulations. The final days involved projects in C/Embedded C, including LED blinking, LED control with push buttons and potentiometers, LED dimming, and serial port output.

Overall, the Summer Development Program Sprint-1 was highly educational and engaging, providing a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Participants gained valuable skills in embedded systems, Agile methodology, product development, version control, and circuit design, preparing them well for future projects and careers in electronics and embedded systems.
