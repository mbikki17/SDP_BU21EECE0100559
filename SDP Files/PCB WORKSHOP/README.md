Welcome to the PCB Workshop README! This document provides an introduction to PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design and outlines the goals and projects for the workshop, including analog circuit design with a half-wave rectifier and digital circuit design with a 4:2 encoder. These circuits will be simulated using Tinkercad and then translated into PCB designs using EasyEDA.

Introduction to PCB Design Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are essential components in electronic devices, providing a platform for connecting and supporting electronic components. PCB design involves creating layouts of conductive pathways, known as traces, on a substrate, typically made of fiberglass-reinforced epoxy. These traces establish electrical connections between components, enabling the flow of current and data within the circuit.

Key aspects of PCB design include:

Schematic Design: Creating a schematic diagram that illustrates the connections between components in the circuit.

PCB Layout: Translating the schematic into a physical layout of traces and components on the PCB.

Component Placement: Strategically positioning components on the PCB to optimize space and minimize signal interference.

Routing: Routing traces to establish electrical connections while adhering to design rules and constraints.

Manufacturing: Generating manufacturing files, such as Gerber files, to facilitate the fabrication of the PCB.

Analog Circuit: Half-Wave Rectifier In the analog circuit portion of the workshop, we will design a half-wave rectifier circuit. A half-wave rectifier converts AC (alternating current) input into pulsating DC (direct current) output by allowing only one half of the input waveform to pass through. This circuit is commonly used in power supplies and signal processing applications.

Digital Circuit: 4:2 Encoder In the digital circuit segment, we will design a 4:2 encoder circuit. A 4:2 encoder takes four input lines and produces a two-bit binary output, encoding the active input line. This type of encoder is used in various digital systems for data compression, error detection, and multiplexing.

Simulation Using Tinkercad We will utilize Tinkercad, an online platform for circuit simulation and 3D design, to simulate our analog and digital circuits. Tinkercad offers a user-friendly interface for creating and testing circuits virtually, providing valuable insights into circuit behavior before proceeding to PCB design.

PCB Design Using EasyEDA Following successful simulations in Tinkercad, we will transition to EasyEDA for PCB design. EasyEDA is a web-based PCB design tool that offers schematic capture, PCB layout, and collaboration features in a convenient online environment. We will translate our circuit schematics into PCB layouts, ensuring proper component placement and trace routing for optimal performance.

Workshop Goals The primary goal of this workshop is to familiarize participants with the fundamentals of PCB design by completing hands-on projects involving analog and digital circuits. By the end of the workshop, participants should gain proficiency in:

Creating schematic diagrams for analog and digital circuits. Translating schematics into PCB layouts using EasyEDA. Understanding the design considerations and constraints involved in PCB layout. Simulating circuit behavior using Tinkercad for validation and testing.
